    "description": "This summer I joined the AWS FSx Control Plane team, building and maintaining the management interfaces that let customers provision, configure, and manage FSx file systems across Windows, NetApp ONTAP, OpenZFS, and Lustre. My primary project is a client-side tag-filtering system for the FSx Console in TypeScript/React, enabling dynamic, multi-resource filtering (file systems, volumes, backups, storage VMs, snapshots) with debounced search and pagination. I’m also writing unit and integration tests to cover edge cases and validate filtering across every FSx resource type, ensuring reliable search and smoother resource discovery.",

    "description": "At the end of my freshman year I joined the Kohl’s Marketplace team, concentrating on third-party seller integration. I enhanced Spring-Boot product-monitoring services by integrating external platform feeds and adding in-memory pagination, which reduced support workload. I architected a Spring Batch pipeline that streams product data into Google Cloud Storage buckets, generating roughly $3.5 million in annual revenue. I also instituted Docker- and Kubernetes-based CI/CD, sustaining 90 % test coverage, and helped refactor a legacy Java microservice into a standalone Kafka consumer to boost horizontal scalability for incoming seller updates.",

    "description": "As Project Lead for a 12-member Agile team partnering with Inogen, I organized sprint planning and weekly stakeholder reviews while driving the full ML pipeline for predictive maintenance of portable oxygen concentrators. I built Random Forest and multivariate LSTM models in Python (TensorFlow, scikit-learn), engineered features from 30 + on-device sensors, tuned hyperparameters, and achieved 81 % accuracy on multi-month hold-out data. Weekly executive briefings translated model insights into actionable maintenance schedules and improved device reliability.",

The services automated onboarding and off-boarding for more than 75 applications, saving ~10 engineer-hours per month.
